# Findings: deploy layer (kickstart -> bootc node -> RKE2 -> day-2)

Workstation: 24 cores, 125 GB RAM, **no /dev/kvm** (AMD-V off in BIOS), so every
VM below runs under QEMU 10.2 TCG (`-accel tcg,thread=multi -cpu max`), 6 vCPU,
8 GiB, 40G qcow2, OVMF, virtio, slirp networking (host = `10.0.2.2`).
Artifact Keeper v1.10.2 on `localhost:30080`. All commands are the `deploy/`
make targets; logs are trimmed, timestamps are local (CDT) unless shown as UTC.

## TL;DR

- **Every gate passes on image v3** (`rocky-edge:10` = `10.2-1` @ `sha256:3e5d6afd...`, and
  `10.2-2` @ `sha256:2c81015a...`), run from a clean disk: unattended kickstart install,
  first boot with SELinux enforcing, RKE2 node Ready, nginx-demo Running from an image
  pulled through Artifact Keeper's Docker Hub proxy, `bootc upgrade` to 10.2-2 (new MOTD,
  new manifests, old digest kept as rollback), `bootc rollback` back to 10.2-1 (old MOTD,
  release-1 manifests re-applied), then a second `bootc rollback` forward to 10.2-2.
- From power-on to a working cluster takes about **17 min under TCG**: 10 min install,
  52 s to ssh, 4.5 min more to node Ready, 1.3 min to workload Running. A day-2
  upgrade takes about 4 min (69 s pull+stage, 148 s reboot).
- Real-install testing caught **two image bugs** that `podman build` and
  `bootc container lint --fatal-warnings` did not (both are now fixed in `image/`):
  1. `/opt` was read-only, so canal could not create `/opt/cni/bin` and the node never went Ready.
  2. `bubblewrap` was missing, so `ostree-finalize-staged` failed at shutdown and
     **`bootc upgrade` silently booted the old image again**.
- The final VM is left running on **10.2-2 (upgraded)**, with 10.2-1 as the rollback:
  `ssh -p 2222 root@localhost`.

## Timings

Run 3, the clean full gate (v3 image, `make vm-clean vm-install vm-boot vm-verify vm-upgrade vm-verify vm-rollback`):

| Stage | Wall time | Detail |
|---|---|---|
| `vm-clean` | 25 s | includes about 20 s for an ACPI poweroff of the previous VM |
| `vm-install` | **601 s** | pxeboot media cached and re-verified (a cold download is about 50 s more for the 214 MB initrd) |
|  - QEMU start to "Starting installer" | 315 s | kernel + initrd + stage2 (`install.img`) fetched over HTTPS from dl.rockylinux.org under TCG |
|  - to "Installing the software" | +60 s | kickstart fetched, storage laid out |
|  - `ostreecontainer` pull + deploy | 195 s | 74 layers, about 463 MB, from `10.0.2.2:30080/oci-bootc/rocky-edge:10` |
|  - post-install to QEMU exit | 30 s | `%post`, bootloader, `reboot` (QEMU `-no-reboot` exits) |
| `vm-boot`: power-on to ssh | **52 s** | (same in runs 1 and 2) |
| `vm-boot`: ssh to node Ready | **272 s** | same in run 2 (324 s from power-on); RKE2 system images pulled through `oci-dockerhub-proxy` |
| `vm-verify`: nginx-demo Running | 76 s after Ready | |
| `vm-upgrade`: promote (`skopeo copy` 10.2-2 -> 10) | 1 s | manifest-only; all blobs already in the repo |
| `vm-upgrade`: `bootc upgrade` pull+stage | **69 s** | "layers needed: 3 (7.8 MB)" (only the site-config layer and its neighbours change) |
| `vm-upgrade`: reboot to ssh | 148 s | includes finalize-staged at shutdown |
| `vm-rollback`: `bootc rollback` + reboot to ssh | 148 s | about 161 s for the whole target |
| after reboot: workload re-settled | 30-105 s | pods restart, manifests re-seeded |

Earlier runs: install 555 s (dev image), 600 s (v1), 585 s (v2).

## Run history (what broke and why)

The harness went through three image revisions. The two failures were both
image-side and both only show up on a real install of a bootc image, never in
`podman build` or `bootc container lint`.

### Run 0: harness shakedown on a stand-in image (`rocky-edge:dev`)

The research agent's k3s bootc image was pushed into Artifact Keeper as
`oci-bootc/rocky-edge:dev` and installed with `make vm-install IMAGE=rocky-edge:dev`:

```

[21:21:28] install: Installation complete (+540s)
[21:21:43] install: done in 555s
```

### Run 1: `rocky-edge:10` v1 -- RKE2 never Ready: `/opt` is read-only

Install 600 s, ssh up 52 s after power-on, SELinux `Enforcing`, `bootc status`
showing `10.0.2.2:30080/oci-bootc/rocky-edge:10` version `10.2-1`, `rke2-server`
active. But the node stayed `NotReady` for the full 20 min:

```
NAMESPACE     NAME                          READY   STATUS                      AGE
default       nginx-demo-5b786799fb-lxktm   0/1     Pending                     7m59s

kube-system   rke2-coredns-...              0/1     Pending                     7m21s

Warning  Failed  kubelet  spec.initContainers{install-cni}: Error: failed to generate
  container "5ab13342..." spec: failed to generate spec: failed to mkdir "/opt/cni/bin":
  mkdir /opt/cni: read-only file system
```

Not a TCG problem: canal's `install-cni` init container hostPath-mounts
`/opt/cni/bin`, and on this bootc image `/opt` is a real directory on the
read-only composefs root (not the classic ostree `/opt -> var/opt` symlink).
The calico image itself had pulled fine through the mirror (55 s). Fixed in the
image (`/opt -> var/opt` plus tmpfiles.d for `/var/opt/cni/bin`).

### Run 2: v2 -- node Ready, workload via proxy, but `bootc upgrade` silently reverts

Install 585 s, ssh 52 s, node Ready 272 s after ssh, nginx-demo Running 39 s
later, image verified in `oci-dockerhub-proxy`. Then `make vm-upgrade`:

```
[22:12:32] upgrade: promote copy took 1s
=== bootc upgrade ===
layers already present: 73; layers needed: 3 (7.7 MB)
Deploying...done (22 seconds)
Queued for next boot: 10.0.2.2:30080/oci-bootc/rocky-edge:10
  Version: 10.2-2
  Digest: sha256:184d5f9f...
[22:16:12] upgrade: reboot to ssh took 148s
  booted:   version: 10.2-1   imageDigest: sha256:8126cf65...      <- still the old one
  rollback: null
[22:16:16] ERROR: booted digest sha256:8126cf65... != staged sha256:184d5f9f...
```

The staged deployment is only written into `/boot` by
`ostree-finalize-staged.service` during shutdown. The serial log shows it
"Stopped" normally, so nothing looked wrong at reboot time. The reason only
appears on the *next* boot, from `ostree-boot-complete.service`:

```
ostree[751]: error: ostree-finalize-staged.service failed on previous boot: Finalizing
  deployment: Finalizing SELinux policy: Failed to execute child process "/usr/bin/bwrap"
  (No such file or directory)
$ rpm -q bubblewrap
package bubblewrap is not installed
```

ostree rebuilds the SELinux policy for the new deployment with `semodule` inside
bubblewrap. That runs here because `rke2-selinux` adds policy modules. The RESF
minimal base does not ship `bubblewrap` (fedora-bootc does). The journal is
volatile on this image, so `journalctl -b -1` had nothing: the diagnosis came from
the serial log plus `systemctl status ostree-boot-complete`.

**Root-cause proof on the same VM, no image change:** `bootc usr-overlay`
(transient writable /usr), `dnf install bubblewrap` (from the Artifact Keeper
repos baked into the image), `bootc upgrade`, reboot:

```
$ rpm -q bubblewrap
bubblewrap-0.10.0-3.el10.x86_64
[22:23:03] guest back after 148s
ostree-boot-complete.service was skipped because no trigger condition checks were met.  <- no failure stamp
  booted:   version 10.2-1  imageDigest: sha256:3e5d6afd...   (the newly staged build)
  rollback: version 10.2-1  imageDigest: sha256:8126cf65...   (previous)
```

With `bwrap` present, finalization succeeds. The image now installs
`bubblewrap` and makes `/var/log/journal` persistent. `vm-upgrade.sh` now prints
the `ostree-boot-complete` journal whenever the booted digest is not the staged one.

### Run 3: v3 -- the full gate from a clean disk

Clean disk (`make vm-clean`), then the full chain against `IMAGE_READY_V3`
(`sha256:3e5d6afd...`). Every stage passed. One harness bug showed up and was
fixed (see the end of this section).

```

(Before the upgrade the MOTD said `edge-site-config 1.0-1.el10: initial site configuration`.)
After the upgrade, RKE2 re-applied the re-seeded manifests and rolled the Deployment:
`nginx-demo ... edge-site/config-release=2`, new pod Running on the same
proxied digest.

**Rollback** (`make vm-rollback`):

```
[22:46:42] booted sha256:2c81015a...; rolling back to sha256:3e5d6afd...
[22:49:19] rollback: reboot to ssh took 148s

[22:49:21] rollback: OK
[22:51:19] verify: OK   nginx-demo ... edge-site/config-release=1
```

The rollback brings back the manifests as well, because
`edge-site-manifests.service` re-seeds `/var/lib/rancher/rke2/server/manifests`
from the booted image's `/usr/share/edge-site/manifests` on every boot. A second
`make vm-rollback` swapped forward again to 10.2-2 (148 s), and
`config-release=2` was back about 2 min after ssh.

**Harness bug found and fixed in this run.** The first `vm-verify` after the
upgrade caught the Deployment mid-rollout: the old pod was Running and the new
one was in ContainerCreating with an empty `imageID`, so it reported
`FAIL: ... digest  not found`. `vm-verify.sh` now waits until `rke2-server` is
active and every matching pod is Running with READY n/n before it checks digests.

## Other observations

- **Digest race when the tag moves mid-install.** `vm-install.sh` logs the tag's
  digest (via `skopeo inspect`) before Anaconda starts, but Anaconda resolves the
  tag about 5 minutes later. In run 1 the image agent re-pushed `:10` in between,
  so the logged digest (`05cd8e2d...`) is not the installed one (`96615947...`).
  Treat `bootc status` as authoritative. A real fleet should install by digest
  (`--url=...@sha256:...`) and track the tag afterwards.
- **Artifact Keeper records some by-digest manifests as size 0** in the
  artifacts API (e.g. `v2/library/nginx/manifests/sha256:df221db8...  0 bytes`,
  the per-platform manifest that containerd resolved from the `alpine` index).
  Pulls work; it is only the listing.
- **containerd does not log which mirror served a pull.** The proof that
  `nginx:alpine` came through Artifact Keeper is that the exact digest in the pod's
  `imageID` exists in `oci-dockerhub-proxy`, created at the same second as the
  `PullImage` line in containerd.log. Every RKE2 system image
  (`rancher/rke2-runtime`, `hardened-kubernetes`, `hardened-etcd`, calico,
  flannel, coredns, klipper-helm, ...) also came through the proxy, because
  `registries.yaml` mirrors all of `docker.io`. Note that RKE2's generated
  `hosts.toml` keeps `https://registry-1.docker.io` as the fallback `server`, so
  an air-gapped site should also block egress.
- **`helm-install-rke2-traefik` errors once or twice** ("Required CRDs are
  missing") before `rke2-traefik-crd` finishes, then succeeds on retry. This is
  the normal RKE2 ordering race, made more visible by TCG.
- **Duplicate kernel args.** `console=ttyS0,115200n8` appears twice on the
  installed cmdline: once from Anaconda (it copies the installer's `console=`)
  and once from the image's `kargs.d`. Harmless.
- **Two insecure-registry drop-ins.** The image ships
  `50-artifact-keeper.conf` and the kickstart `%post` writes
  `50-poc-insecure.conf` with the same `[[registry]]` entry. containers-image
  accepts the duplicate. The `%post` copy is a belt-and-braces for images that
  forget it.
- **SSH under slirp.** Every host connection arrives from `10.0.2.2`, so
  OpenSSH `PerSourcePenalties` would punish the host as a whole. The wait loop
  (`BatchMode=yes`, one key, 10-15 s between tries) never tripped it in about 12
  boots.
- **Clean shutdown under TCG takes about 90 s** (`vm-stop`: RKE2 and containerd
  teardown), and a reboot to ssh takes about 150 s.
